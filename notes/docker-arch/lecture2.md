1.  **Virtual Machines (VMs):**

    - **Structure:**
      - **Infrastructure:** The hardware layer, which could be a laptop or server.
      - **Host Operating System:** The OS installed on the hardware, e.g., macOS.
      - **Hypervisor:** A software layer that virtualizes the hardware, allowing multiple VMs to run.
      - **Guest Operating Systems:** Multiple operating systems installed on the hypervisor, e.g., Linux, Solaris.
      - **Binaries and Libraries:** Each guest OS has its own set of binaries and libraries.
      - **Applications:** Each VM runs its own applications independently.
    - **Functionality:**
      - Virtualizes the infrastructure layer, allowing multiple OS instances on the same hardware.
      - Each VM is isolated with its own OS, binaries, libraries, and applications.

2.  **Docker Containers:**

    - **Structure:**
      - **Infrastructure:** The hardware layer, same as VMs.
      - **Host Operating System:** The OS installed on the hardware, e.g., macOS.
      - **Docker Daemon:** A software layer that virtualizes the operating system, allowing multiple containers to run.
      - **Containers:** Containers share the host OS kernel but have their own set of binaries and libraries.
      - **Applications:** Each container runs its own application using shared OS resources.
    - **Functionality:**
      - Virtualizes the operating system layer, allowing multiple containers to share the same OS kernel.
      - Containers are lightweight as they don't require a full OS installation.
      - Faster boot-up times compared to VMs because they don't need to initialize a full OS.

3.  **Advantages of Docker Containers Over VMs:**

    - **Lightweight:** Containers share the host OS, avoiding the overhead of multiple OS instances.
    - **Faster Boot-Up:** Containers start quickly since they leverage the existing host OS without needing a full OS boot sequence.

By understanding these differences, you can see how Docker containers provide a more efficient and faster environment for running applications compared to traditional VMs. This knowledge is crucial as you move forward with Docker and containers.

# Summary of the benefits of Docker:

1.  **Isolation:**

    - Docker ensures each container runs its own resources, isolated from others.
    - This allows for separate applications running different stacks in different containers without interference.

2.  **Lightweight:**

    - Docker containers share the host operating system, avoiding the overhead of multiple OS instances.
    - This makes containers have a lightweight footprint with minimal overhead, facilitating rapid deployment.

3.  **Cost Savings:**

    - Docker's efficient use of resources means fewer resources are needed to run applications.
    - This reduces infrastructure costs and the manpower needed to maintain the infrastructure.

4.  **Portability:**

    - Docker containers can run consistently across various environments (e.g., Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace).
    - This portability ensures the application runs the same way on different platforms as long as Docker is supported.

5.  **Scalability:**

    - Docker makes it easy to spawn new containers to handle additional load.
    - Organizations benefit from scalable container platforms without needing to build extensive in-house infrastructure.

6.  **Sharing:**

    - Docker provides a repository to share images, allowing others to use pre-configured container images.
    - For example, a MySQL container image created by one person can be used by another on a different cloud platform.

These are some key benefits of Docker that highlight its efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, making it a valuable tool for modern application development and deployment.

- **rogramming Language:**

  - Docker is written in Go (also known as Golang), a statically typed and compiled programming language designed by Google. Other popular tools like Terraform are also written in Go.- **Operating System Support:**

  - Docker is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS, covering a wide range of operating systems.- **Initial Use of LXC:**

  - In its early stages, Docker used LXC (LinuX Containers), which utilizes the Linux kernel's namespaces and control groups to isolate processes and manage resources. Docker later replaced LXC with its own library called libcontainer, also written in Go.- **Docker Hub:**

  - Docker Hub (hub.docker.com) is the central repository for finding, pulling, and sharing Docker images. Users can sign up and use it to manage their containerized applications.- **Cloud Vendor Support:**

  - Docker is supported by major cloud vendors such as AWS, Oracle Cloud, and Azure, providing portability and consistent functionality across different platforms.- **Mission-Critical Applications:**

  - Docker is used in mission-critical applications, such as NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), a space probe project for planetary defense.- **Docker Swarm:**

  - Docker Swarm allows the formation of a cluster of Docker machines. Commands executed on a Swarm are managed by a swarm manager, providing a scalable and robust clustering solution.

- **Docker Engine on Linux:**

  - Docker Engine itself runs on Linux. However, Mac and Linux are different operating systems.- **Challenge for Docker:**

  - Since many sysadmins and developers use Mac, Docker had to find a way to run Docker on Mac, despite Docker Engine being available only on Linux.- **Docker Desktop for Mac:**

  - Docker Desktop for Mac uses a hypervisor to install a lightweight Linux operating system to run Docker.- **Checking Docker Processes:**

  - On a Mac, if you run `docker ps` or `docker version`, Docker commands work.
  - However, running `ps -ef | grep dockerd` shows no Docker daemon running directly on the Mac.- **Accessing the Linux VM:**

  - Docker Desktop uses a hypervisor to run a Linux VM. To access this VM, you can use a hack:

    - Run the command: `screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty`
    - This opens a screen session into the Linux VM.- **Verifying the Linux Environment:**

  - Inside this screen session, commands like `uname -a` show that it's a Linux environment.
  - Running `ps -ef | grep dockerd` inside this screen session shows the Docker daemon running.- **Conclusion:**

  - Although it appears that Docker is running directly on your Mac, it's actually running on a Linux VM managed by Docker Desktop.
  - This setup allows you to use Docker on Mac by providing a layer of abstraction through the hypervisor.
