1.  **Killing a Container:**

    - The `docker kill` command is used to stop a running container. You can provide either the container name or ID.
    - Example: `docker kill <container_name_or_id>`
    - This command forcefully stops the container. The status of the container can be checked using `docker ps -a` to see whether it has exited and if so, the exit code (e.g., `137` for an error).

2.  **Container Logs:**

    - The `docker logs` command retrieves logs of a running container. You can view the last 100 lines using `docker logs --tail 100 <container_name_or_id>`.
    - Example: `docker logs --tail 100 <container_name_or_id>`
    - This is helpful to identify issues if a container has exited with an error. In the demo, there were some warnings regarding memory and storage, indicating potential issues to address.

3.  **Exit Codes:**

    - When a container exits, it provides an exit code to indicate its status:
      - `Exit 0` means the container executed successfully.
      - `Exit 137` indicates an error or abnormal termination (e.g., due to memory issues or system constraints).

4.  **Docker Image Handling:**

    - The demo mentions that Docker images can be pre-downloaded (from Docker Hub or custom images). If the image is already present locally, running it becomes faster since Docker does not need to download it again.
    - The `docker run` command is used to start a container from an image. Example: `docker run -d <image_name>`.

5.  **Docker Hub and Custom Images:**

    - The upcoming section will cover building custom images and pushing them to Docker Hub, which are important for managing your own Docker containers and images.

These concepts are fundamental for working with Docker containers and managing their lifecycle (creation, inspection, and termination), which will be useful
